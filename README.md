# Social-Media-Integrity-ML-and-NLP-Approaches-to-Fake-Profile-Detection
This project is a Fake Account Detector developed using Flask, Keras, and machine learning. The system is designed to identify fake accounts on social media or websites by analyzing patterns and user behavior data. It uses a trained machine learning model (saved as a .keras file) to make predictions based on user input.
